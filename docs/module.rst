Creating modules
================

Creating new modules ("things that display something") to contribute
to i3pystatus is reasonably easy. If the module you want to write
updates it's info periodically, like checking for a network link or
displaying the status of some service, then we have prepared common
tools for this which make this even easier:

- Common base classes: :py:class:`i3pystatus.core.modules.Module` for
  everything and :py:class:`i3pystatus.core.modules.IntervalModule`
  specifically for the aforementioned usecase of updating stuff
  periodically.
- Settings (already built into above classes) allow you to easily
  specify user-modifiable attributes of your class for configuration.
- For modules that require credentials, it is recommended to add a
  keyring_backend setting to allow users to specify their own backends
  for retrieving sensitive credentials. 

  Required settings and default values are also handled.

Check out i3pystatus' source code for plenty of (`simple
<https://github.com/enkore/i3pystatus/blob/master/i3pystatus/mem.py>`_)
examples on how to build modules.

Also note that the settings system is built to ease documentation. If
you specify two-tuples ``("setting", "description")`` description then
:py:mod:`i3pystatus.mkdocs` will automatically generate a nice table
listing each option, it's default value and description.

The docstring of your module class is automatically used as the
restructuredtext description for your module in the README file.
